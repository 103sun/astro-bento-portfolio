### The Intersection of History and Policy
My current research focuses on the pivotal moments when Western economic thought met Chinese reform-era policy. Milton Friedman's visits in the 1980s represent a unique case study in intellectual diplomacy. Milton Friedman's papers at the **Hoover Institution** provide a behind-the-scene perspective of those visits and a real-time asessment of the prospect of the Chinese economy.

#### Key Research Questions:
* **The 1980 Lecture Series:** How did the Chinese leadership interpret Friedman's "Price Theory" during his first visit?
* **Meeting Zhao Ziyang:** Analyzing the transcripts of the 1988 meeting and the subsequent shift in price reform.
* **Legacy:** How do these historical visits inform the current "Stanford Abundance" framework?

> "The Chinese people are the same as people everywhere. They want to improve their lives. They are industrious, they are energetic." — *Milton Friedman, 1988*

### Project Status
This project is currently under development. I am currently reviewing several key documents related to the 1988 visit at the **Hoover Institute**.
